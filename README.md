# National Autonomous Relief and Aid (NARA) Sample Code

When disaster strikes, getting the right information to the right people is paramount to public safety. However, as multiple sources push out new information, disaster victims get information overload or don't get information at all.

For disaster victims NARA is an interactive alert system on platforms people already use like SMS and Facebook Messenger. NARA provides victims an avenue to ask questions regarding changing situations outside. Using natural language processing, NARA responds to frequently asked questions from non-emergency calls made to 911.

For emergency management teams, NARA is a sophisticated alert system that allows for targeted messages to be pushed out based on disaster victims' geography, user needs, and self-reported safety statuses. NARA allows first response teams to provide detailed information in alerts with external links, images, and videos. Conversations with NARA reduce traffic to critical websites and 911 call centers.

NARA helps first response teams and disaster victims exchange personalized information, reducing information overload and confusion, and resulting in effective responses to rapidly-changing situations.
